# FullCalendar for Flow
This addon is an integration of the [FullCalendar](https://fullcalendar.io/) as a Flow component. It is based on version 6 of the
FullCalendar library.

## Requirements / versions / support
There are several versions of the addon
* Version 7, based on Vaadin 25 / Java 21
* Version 6, based on Vaadin 14 / Java 11, which should also support any version up to Vaadin 24.

Addon versions prior to the current major version are not supported. If you need a fix for such a version
feel free to fork the project. You may create an issue, but due to limited time it is very unlikely, that we will fix
it.

Please also have a look at the demo for some basic examples and source code of how to integrate the FC.
For more examples please have a look into the example section.

## FullCalendar Scheduler for Flow addon
This separate addon extends the **FullCalendar for Flow** addon with the FullCalendar Scheduler, which provides
additional resource based views (Timeline View and Vertical Resource View).

For information about the Scheduler (functionality, features, license information, etc.)

### License information:
Please be aware, that the FullCalender Scheduler library this addon is based on has a different license model
then the basic FullCalendar. For details about the license, visit https://fullcalendar.io/license.

**The scheduler addon does not provide any commercial license for the Scheduler. The license model of MIT does only affect
the additional files of this addon, not the used original files.**
