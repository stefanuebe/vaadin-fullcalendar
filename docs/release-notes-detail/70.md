# Release notes for 7.0

The main change in version 7 is the requirement for Vaadin 25, which includes the new requirement
for at least Java 21. 

Since element Json is gone and Jackson 3 is the new player on the field, json related things have been
reworked to use Jackson types instead of elemental Json ones. Some method names have changed to align better with 
the handled types.

## Theming
The FullCalendar theme variant `LUMO` has been renamed to `VAADIN` to cover all themes at once. This should
affect you only, when you have explicitly removed the theme variant.

The Vaadin theming now covers Lumo and Aura and applies the respective styles to the calendar. As before,
there might be variables or cases, where the styling is not applied correctly or missing - in this case
please open a github issue.

## Other
The class `BusinessHours` has been reworked. The constructors have been removed and instead
there are now static methods to define new instance. The api also has been changed to allow a fluent definition
style of business hours.


Deprecated APIs have been marked as `forRemoval` and will be removed with one of the next minor releases.
