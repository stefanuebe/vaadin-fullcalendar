# Release notes for 7.0

The main change in version 7 is the requirement for Vaadin 25, which includes the new requirement
for at least Java 21. 

The class `BusinessHours` has been reworked. The constructors have been removed and instead
there are now static methods to define new instance. The api also has been changed to allow a fluent definition
style of business hours.

Deprecated APIs have been marked as `forRemoval` and will be removed with one of the next minor releases.
